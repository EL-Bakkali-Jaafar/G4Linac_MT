<b><h2>About G4Linac_MT</h2> </b> 
G4Linac_MT  is a new simple-to-use open source code developed to facilitate the use of Geant4 C++ toolkit for the simulation of medical linear accelerator which is a common therapeutic machine used  to treat patients having cancer diseases. The principal goal in development of the present code is to provide to scientific researchers whom don’t have a deep knowledge in C++ programming a easy-to-use framework for modeling existing linac machines, developing new ones, as well as studding the radiation safety in treatment of patients with modeled linac machines. G4Linac_MT  is an open-source C++ program which uses some external libraries, namely, last stable version of Geant4 code (10.05) used as Monte-Carlo physics engine, HDF5-C++library used in developing of a new phase space file format, ROOT-C++ package used for  data analysis and valgrind debugging tool used to detected and resolve program run errors. A Java-based application called G4Linac_GUI  has been developed and provides well-developed GUI components assuring a convivial graphical user interface for G4Linac_MT code.
